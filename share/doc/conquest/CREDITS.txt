  Orion textures.  These were created by painting/texturing 3D meshes
  in blender.  These meshes came from ShareCG.com.

  I imported these into blender (blender.com), and after much learning
  (and swearing), painted/textured them so they could be rendered as
  a ship texture for Conquest.  Keeping in mind, blender is not real
  good at 'importing' foreign formats. :) See img/src/blender/ for the
  .blender src files I'm using, and a README.

  Specifically:

    - Orion Scout:

      I really like the 'cammo' texture he supplied, and use it on
      all of the Orion models.

    - Orion Destroyer:

    - Orion Cruiser:

      Same general color scheme I used for the scout.  Stargate fans
      may recognize this ship :)
